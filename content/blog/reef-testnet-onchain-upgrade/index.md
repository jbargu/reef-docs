At block [29,510](https://reefscan.com/block/?blockNumber=29510) the Reef Testnet 2 got its first on-chain upgrade.

This upgrade includes the first stable implementation of Proof of Consensus [module](https://github.com/reef-defi/reef-chain/tree/master/modules/poc/src) and a fast (1 day) election cycle.
