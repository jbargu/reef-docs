This release contains multiple breaking changes, however the EVM implementation is now considered stable.
The main focus of this release is extensive testing and deployment of EVM applications on top of Reef chain.

With this release we have also shipped the **[EVM Playground](https://evm.reefscan.com)**, which can be used to deploy and
interact with EVM smart contracts on Reef chain.
