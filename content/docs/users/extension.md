Reef extension is kind of like Metamask, but for Reef chain. You can get it for **[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reefjs-extension/mjgkpalnahacmhkikiommfiomhjipgjn)** and **[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reef-js-extension/)**.

If you are a developer, check out the [integration guide](https://github.com/reef-defi/browser-extension#readme).
