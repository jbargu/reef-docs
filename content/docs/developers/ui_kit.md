## What is Reef UI kit?

Reef UI kit contains pre-made components for building dapps on Reef. It comes with a consistent design language and support for most popular web frameworks.

The components can be used to build wallets, block explorers and dapps. They handle thigs like account selection, wallets, balances, token holdings, NFTs, various transaction types and events, etc.

A few open-source apps built with the UI kit are:

 - [Reef App](https://app.reef.io) is a wallet, dex and token creator for Reef ([source](https://github.com/reef-defi/reef-app))
 - [Reefscan](https://reefscan.com) is a block explorer for Reef ([source](https://github.com/reef-defi/reef-explorer))
